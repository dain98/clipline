Clipline is an open-source desktop recorder for saving gameplay replays, full-session recordings, and reviewable clips without ads, accounts, telemetry, watermarks, or game injection.

It uses Windows.Graphics.Capture for no-injection capture, hardware encoders where available, local game APIs for timeline markers, and a built-in review player for scrubbing and lossless trim.

## Status

Clipline is nightly, testing-grade Windows software. Expect rough edges, and please file issues with your Windows version, GPU, encoder, game, capture mode, and logs when something misbehaves.

The installer is not Authenticode code-signed yet, so Windows SmartScreen may warn on first run. The updater bundle itself is signed. See the [install docs](https://dain98.github.io/clipline-docs/desktop/install) for the practical details.

## Development

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/dain98/clipline.git
cd clipline
cargo run -p clipline-app
```

Useful checks:

```powershell
cargo test --workspace
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

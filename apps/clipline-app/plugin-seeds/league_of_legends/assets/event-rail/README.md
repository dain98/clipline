# Event rail icons

`kill.png` and `death.png` are first-party generated Clipline silhouettes used
only in the right-side League event rail.

`dragon.png`, `baron.png`, and `turret.png` are League client match-history
assets mirrored by CommunityDragon for the right-side League event rail. Riot
Games owns the underlying League of Legends artwork and trademarks; Clipline
does not claim third-party rights over these images.

Timeline marker icons live separately in `assets/markers/`.

Keep each event rail PNG on a 320x320 transparent canvas with a 280px-tall
visible alpha box, centered vertically. The match events sidebar relies on
matching alpha bounds instead of per-icon CSS sizing overrides.

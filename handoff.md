## What this project is

Clipline is an open-source, lightweight, ad-free game recorder for Windows (see `ddoc.md`):
ShadowPlay-style replay buffer, **no DLL injection ever** (anti-cheat safety is the core
architectural bet), automatic timeline event markers via the League of Legends Live Client
Data API, Hybrid MP4 output, Rust core + Tauri UI.

## Current state (2026-06-12): a working tray recorder with trim/export

Ten milestones executed (plans in `docs/superpowers/plans/*.md` — fifteen plan docs, all
completed task-by-task with strict TDD; read any of them to see the conventions in action):

1. **WGC capture** — monitor + window, GPU-side frames, QPC-anchored pts
2. **MFT H.264 encoder** — async hardware MFT (AMF on the dev box), GPU NV12 path, AVCC out
3. **WASAPI loopback audio** — system audio → real Opus (audiopus), silence gap fill
4. **A/V sync hardening** — stamp-derived MP4 timeline, one shared clock, `avsync` validator
   (real-engine test: −8.3 ms total drift)
5. **Tauri shell** — `apps/clipline-app`: tray app, replay-buffer service thread, **Alt+F10**
   global hotkey → `Videos\Clipline\clip_<unix>.mp4`, smart no-overlap saves
6. **Event markers** — League poller (1 Hz, quiet retry outside matches) → `MarkerLog` →
   `<clip>.markers.json` sidecars re-based to clip time; mock-server verified end-to-end
7. **Library + marker timeline** — clip list (duration/size/age/marker badge), in-app playback
   (H.264+Opus `<video>` works in WebView2 via the asset protocol), marker ticks with
   click-to-seek, path-validated delete
8. **Disk quota + auto-GC** — neutral storage manager scans `Videos\Clipline`, counts MP4s plus
   marker sidecars, enforces a default 10 GiB oldest-first quota after saves, protects the
   just-saved clip, and surfaces usage/quota/clip count in the UI. `--disk-quota-gb 0` disables
   GC; any positive number sets the GiB cap.
9. **Settings** — `%APPDATA%\Clipline\settings.json` persists capture target, buffer/replay
   seconds, bitrate, FPS, disk quota, and save hotkey. The in-app Settings panel validates and
   saves changes, restarts the recorder service with new recording options, rebinds the global
   hotkey, updates the tray label, and keeps the storage row on the active quota.
10. **Trim/export editor** — the player overlay now has in/out controls and exports a sibling MP4
    without touching the source clip. `clipline-mp4::trim_keyframe_aligned` parses Clipline's
    finalized H.264/Opus MP4 tables, aligns start backward and end forward to video keyframes,
    stream-copies selected samples into a fresh finalized MP4, and crops marker sidecars.

Run it: `cargo run -p clipline-app` (settings persist under `%APPDATA%\Clipline\settings.json`;
options still override startup behavior: `--window <title substring>` to capture one window
instead of the primary monitor, `--lol-url <url>` to point the marker poller at a mock, and
`--disk-quota-gb <n>` to override the saved quota for that launch).
Useful examples: `record_smoke -- --seconds 5 --window <w> --audio` (full pipeline + sync
report + ffprobe), `wgc_smoke` (capture only). Everything is verified live on this machine —
real clips with matching A/V durations, real marker sidecars, real in-app playback.

| Crate | What it does | Verified by |
|---|---|---|
| `clipline-events` | Event schema (ddoc §5), game-clock→recording anchor math, `MarkerLog`/`ClipMarkers` sidecars | unit tests |
| `clipline-lol` | League Live Client adapter: client, dedupe, normalization, `poll_once` | httpmock integration + `markers_e2e` |
| `clipline-buffer` | Replay ring of GOP segments (video + N audio tracks), byte eviction, `save_window` smart mode | unit tests |
| `clipline-storage` | Saved-clip inventory, sidecar-aware size accounting, oldest-first quota GC with protected fresh saves | unit tests |
| `clipline-mp4` | Hybrid MP4 muxer (frag→finalized in place), multi-track h264+Opus, box walker, `movie_duration_s`, keyframe-aligned stream-copy trim | ffprobe + unit tests |
| `clipline-capture` | Traits + mocks + `Recorder` (steppable, save-while-recording) + **all real Windows engines** under `src/windows/` (`wgc`, `mft`, `nv12`, `wasapi`, `mft_probe`, `d3d11`) + neutral `annexb`/`opus`/`pcm`/`clock`/`avsync` | mocks on CI; CI-skipped device tests run real on the dev machine |
| `apps/clipline-app` | Tauri 2 shell: service thread, configurable hotkey, tray, status/library/player/settings/editor UI | live e2e (screenshots in the session logs) |

## Machine setup (already done on this machine; for a fresh clone elsewhere)

1. **Git identity** (repo-local, doesn't travel): `git config user.email "dain98@gmail.com"`,
   `git config user.name "Dain"` — commits are authored by the personal account.
2. **Remote/auth:** repo is `https://github.com/dain98/clipline.git` over **HTTPS** with gh as
   credential helper (`gh auth setup-git`, account `dain98`). Don't switch to SSH — the
   machine's agent key belongs to a different GitHub account.
3. **Rust** stable + clippy. `cargo test --workspace` must be green before starting.
4. **ffmpeg/ffprobe** (winget `Gyan.FFmpeg`) — the ffprobe e2e tests self-skip without it.
   On this machine the binaries live under
   `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\WinGet\Packages\Gyan.FFmpeg_...\ffmpeg-8.1.1-full_build\bin`
   (fresh shells get them on PATH; long-lived shells may need the full path).

## Development conventions (unchanged since day one — keep them)

- **Plan-driven TDD.** Each milestone gets `docs/superpowers/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>.md` with
  complete code and bite-sized steps; execute strictly failing-test-first. Plans are committed
  before execution; checkboxes stay unticked (repo convention).
- **Commits:** conventional style (`feat(capture): …`), one logical change, trailer
  `Co-Authored-By: Claude Fable 5 <noreply@anthropic.com>` when Claude authors.
- **Quality gates per milestone:** workspace tests green, `cargo clippy --workspace
  --all-targets` zero warnings, push, **CI green on ubuntu + windows**, handoff updated.
- **Platform discipline:** neutral logic stays neutral (testable on both CI OSes); Windows
  code behind `#[cfg(windows)]`; trait changes happen neutral-side first with tests; all
  `unsafe` confined to `windows/` modules behind safe wrappers.

## Sharp edges (each of these cost real debugging time — read before touching)

**CI / testing**
- Device tests (WGC, MFT, WASAPI, real-clock sync) are **hard-skipped under `CI`**:
  windows-2025 runners report `IsSupported()==true` for WGC then access-violate inside the
  capture component; they have no hardware encoder or audio endpoint. Local runs exercise
  them for real — the dev machine (RX 6700 XT, 5120x1440 primary) is the test rig.
- CI clippy can fail on lints a **warm local cache hides** — `cargo clean -p <crate>` before
  trusting a local clippy pass on changed crates.
- `clipline-app` keeps ubuntu CI webkit-free by gating *all* Tauri deps under
  `[target.'cfg(windows)'.dependencies]` with a stub `main` elsewhere; `build.rs` gates
  `tauri_build::build()` on `CARGO_CFG_WINDOWS`.

**Media pipeline**
- `clipline-mp4` wants **4-byte length-prefixed NALs**; MFTs emit Annex B — `annexb.rs`
  converts (and strips AUD/SPS/PPS). B-frames must stay **disabled** (no ctts in the muxer).
- The MP4 timeline is **duration-cumulative**: video durations are re-derived from capture
  stamps at GOP seal; audio gaps become silence (`pcm.rs`); audio recorded before the first
  video packet is dropped (engine-init lead-in shifted video ~63 ms early before the fix —
  `avsync::validate_timeline` caught it on its first real run).
- WASAPI loopback requires a **48 kHz float mix format** (resampler is a follow-up); loopback
  goes quiet when nothing renders — that's why the gap fill exists.
- One D3D device and one `RelativeClock` must be shared across capture/encode/audio —
  the constructors force it (`WgcCapture::new_clock()`, `*_on(device, …, clock)`).
- H.264 hardware encoders cap near 4096 wide; the 5120-wide monitor scales to ≤2560
  (`even_dimensions` + scale in service/smokes).

**Tauri (v2)**
- The webview **silently no-ops** (no events, no invoke) without
  `capabilities/default.json` granting `core:default`.
- The assetProtocol scope **does not resolve `$VIDEO`** — use a plain glob
  (`**/Videos/Clipline/*.mp4`). Diagnose media errors via a `video.onerror` handler; error
  code 4 usually means the scope rejected the request, not a codec problem.
- H.264+Opus MP4 plays natively in WebView2 — no native decode path needed until AV1/HEVC.
- `tauri-build` requires `icons/icon.ico` (ours is ffmpeg-generated).

**Misc**
- League Live Client testing without a match: `--lol-url` + the httpmock pattern in
  `crates/clipline-lol/tests/markers_e2e.rs`; a tiny local mock server works against the
  real app (see plan 2026-06-11-clipline-event-markers.md).
- Storage GC is save-time only for now. Default cap is 10 GiB; `--disk-quota-gb <n>` overrides
  it and `0` disables it. GC deletes MP4s oldest-first with matching `.markers.json` sidecars,
  but intentionally refuses to delete the clip that was just saved even if that leaves the
  directory over budget.
- Settings saves restart the recorder service immediately. Bad window-capture titles pass
  validation if non-empty, then surface as service init errors. Hotkey support is intentionally
  limited to modifiers plus F-keys (`Alt+F10`, `Ctrl+Alt+F10`, `Ctrl+Shift+F9`, etc.).
- Trim/export is intentionally v1: finalized Clipline-authored MP4s only, H.264 video with optional
  Opus audio, one sample description per track, no frame-accurate boundary re-encode yet. Exports
  are keyframe-aligned: in snaps backward to the previous sync sample and out snaps forward to the
  next sync sample/EOF, so the exported range can be wider than the numeric in/out request.
- UI automation: occluded windows swallow synthesized clicks while `PrintWindow`
  (PW_RENDERFULLCONTENT) still captures the window content — reposition/topmost before
  clicking; `CopyFromScreen` shows black for accelerated webviews.
- `ddoc.md` Caveats section lists every externally-verified Windows API claim with nuance —
  check it before trusting API behavior.

## What's next (rough value order; each gets its own plan)

1. **Auto-clip on importance** (ddoc §5): `importance ≥ threshold` → auto-save; marker kinds
   already carry importance.
2. **Frame-accurate trim polish** (ddoc §11): re-encode only boundary GOPs, keep the current
   stream-copy path as the instant/lossless mode.
3. **FFmpeg encoder matrix** (ddoc §4: LGPL dynamic link): NVENC/QSV backends, AV1/HEVC,
   software x264 tier; the probe enum already models it.
4. **Per-process audio loopback + mic track** (ddoc §10): multi-track muxing already works.
5. **Polish toward release:** display-capture privacy warning (ddoc §9), borderless-fullscreen
   guidance (§8), WebView2-destroyed-when-minimized RAM trick (§4), installer/signing (§4).

Also worth knowing: `Videos\Clipline` on this machine holds test clips from the milestone
verifications (including `clip_1781160331.mp4` + sidecar — the marked test clip the library
demos nicely). The app may still be running in the tray from the last session.
